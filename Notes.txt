Why ShadCDN => to make changes directly in the component made
(rather than in chakra - need to make changes in props)

Route Groups => don;t affect URL
can mark a folder as a Route Group to prevent the folder from being included in the route's URL path.
This allows you to organize your route segments and project files into logical groups without affecting the URL path structure.
